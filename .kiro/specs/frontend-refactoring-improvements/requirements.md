# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QRMFG frontend application requires comprehensive refactoring and improvements to address critical issues identified in the code audit. Based on the detailed analysis of 47 JavaScript/JSX files, the application has a solid foundation (3.5/5 rating) but suffers from specific critical issues: large monolithic components (Users.js 300+ lines, PlantView.js 400+ lines), insecure JWT token management, duplicate API implementations (both fetch and axios), missing error boundaries, and code quality issues including unused imports and deprecated Ant Design props. This feature aims to systematically address these issues while maintaining functionality and improving maintainability, security, and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Large Component Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large monolithic components broken down into smaller, focused components so that I can easily maintain, test, and debug the application without dealing with 300+ line files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Users.js component (currently 300+ lines) is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into UserTable, UserModal, and PlantAssignmentForm components each under 150 lines
2. WHEN PlantView.js component (currently 400+ lines) is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into PlantDashboard, WorkflowTable, and FilterPanel components each under 150 lines
3. WHEN complex state logic exists in large components THEN it SHALL be extracted into custom hooks (useUserManagement, usePlantAssignment, usePlantWorkflows, useWorkflowFilters)
4. WHEN components have mixed concerns (UI logic, business logic, API calls) THEN they SHALL be separated with business logic moved to service layer
5. WHEN useReducer is needed for complex state THEN it SHALL replace multiple useState calls in refactored components
6. WHEN components are refactored THEN they SHALL maintain existing functionality without breaking changes
7. WHEN performance issues exist due to unnecessary re-renders THEN React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 2: JWT Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my JWT authentication tokens to be stored securely with proper validation so that my session cannot be compromised by XSS attacks or token manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted using AES encryption before storage in sessionStorage (not localStorage)
2. WHEN JWT tokens are retrieved THEN they SHALL be decrypted and validated for structure (3 parts), expiry, issuer, and audience
3. WHEN JWT parsing occurs THEN it SHALL include proper signature validation instead of manual parsing
4. WHEN token expiry is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically clear storage and redirect to /qrmfg/login
5. WHEN SecureTokenStorage class is implemented THEN it SHALL provide setToken, getToken, and removeToken methods with encryption
6. WHEN JWTValidator class is implemented THEN it SHALL provide validateToken and validateClaims methods
7. WHEN tokens are handled THEN they SHALL never be logged to console or exposed in error messages
8. WHEN authentication service is updated THEN it SHALL use SecureTokenStorage and JWTValidator instead of direct localStorage access

### Requirement 3: API Layer Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, consistent API client instead of duplicate implementations so that I can maintain and debug API interactions more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use only Axios client (remove fetch-based api.js implementation)
2. WHEN APIClient class is created THEN it SHALL provide unified request/response interceptors with 30-second timeout
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently through centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
4. WHEN 401 unauthorized errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically clear tokens and redirect to login
5. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL automatically include Bearer token from SecureTokenStorage
6. WHEN API calls fail THEN they SHALL include retry logic for network errors (not 4xx/5xx errors)
7. WHEN workflowAPI service is updated THEN all apiRequest calls SHALL be replaced with apiClient calls
8. WHEN migration is complete THEN api/api.js and api/apiClient.js SHALL be removed and imports updated

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Error Boundary Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully with recovery options so that I can continue using the application even when components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN App.js is updated THEN it SHALL be wrapped with AppErrorBoundary for application-level error handling
2. WHEN routes are defined THEN each route SHALL be wrapped with RouteErrorBoundary providing route-specific error context
3. WHEN async operations are performed THEN they SHALL be wrapped with AsyncErrorBoundary with retry functionality
4. WHEN critical components are rendered THEN they SHALL be wrapped with ComponentErrorBoundary for component-specific errors
5. WHEN error boundaries catch errors THEN they SHALL display user-friendly messages with "Go Home" and "Retry" options
6. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be reported to monitoring service with error context (component, route, user)
7. WHEN error boundaries are implemented THEN they SHALL not expose sensitive system information to users
8. WHEN specialized error boundaries are created THEN they SHALL extend base ErrorBoundary with specific error handling logic

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Standards Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, consistent code with no unused imports or deprecated props so that I can work efficiently without code quality issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint rules are configured THEN they SHALL enforce no-unused-vars, react-hooks/exhaustive-deps, and no-unused-imports as errors
2. WHEN unused imports exist (FilterOutlined, Spin, etc.) THEN they SHALL be automatically removed via ESLint --fix
3. WHEN deprecated Ant Design props are used (destroyOnClose={true}) THEN they SHALL be updated to current syntax (destroyOnClose)
4. WHEN useEffect hooks are implemented THEN they SHALL include proper cleanup functions with AbortController for API calls
5. WHEN code is formatted THEN it SHALL follow Prettier configuration with consistent formatting
6. WHEN magic numbers or hardcoded strings exist THEN they SHALL be replaced with named constants
7. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL include PropTypes or TypeScript type definitions
8. WHEN pre-commit hooks are configured THEN they SHALL prevent commits with linting errors or formatting issues

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization and Bundle Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond smoothly so that I can work efficiently without performance delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components receive stable props THEN they SHALL be wrapped with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN expensive calculations are performed THEN they SHALL be memoized using useMemo with proper dependencies
3. WHEN functions are passed to child components THEN they SHALL be memoized using useCallback
4. WHEN large lists are displayed THEN they SHALL use proper key props (item.id, not array index)

6. WHEN imports from libraries are made THEN they SHALL import only needed components (import { Button, Table } from 'antd')
7. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL be optimized and loaded lazily where appropriate
8. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately to reduce redundant requests
