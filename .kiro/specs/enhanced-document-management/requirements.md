# Enhanced Document Management Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the document management system with two key features: automatic document reuse when extending workflows to different plants, and document attachment functionality in the query system. These enhancements will improve efficiency and communication throughout the MSDS workflow process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Document Reuse in Plant Extensions

**User Story:** As a JVC user extending workflows to multiple plants, I want ALL documents attached at any point in time for the same project/material combination to be automatically reused, so that I don't have to manually upload the same documents multiple times regardless of where they were originally attached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JVC user extends a workflow to multiple plants THEN the system SHALL automatically identify ALL existing documents for the same project/material combination from ANY source (workflow, query, response)
2. WHEN documents exist for the same project/material THEN the system SHALL automatically attach ALL these documents to newly created workflows regardless of their original attachment point
3. WHEN documents were originally attached to queries or responses THEN the system SHALL still make them available for workflow reuse
4. WHEN documents are auto-reused THEN the system SHALL log the reuse action, maintain references to original documents, and track the original source (workflow/query/response)
5. WHEN displaying workflow creation results THEN the system SHALL show which documents were automatically reused and their original sources
6. WHEN no existing documents are found THEN the system SHALL proceed with workflow creation without documents

### Requirement 2: Query Creation with Document Attachment

**User Story:** As a user creating a query, I want to attach supporting documents, so that I can provide additional context and evidence for my query.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new query THEN the system SHALL provide a document upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects files to attach THEN the system SHALL validate file types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, JPG, PNG) and size limits (max 25MB per file)
3. WHEN a user uploads documents THEN the system SHALL store them securely and associate them with the query
4. WHEN a query is created with attachments THEN the system SHALL display the attachment count in the query list
5. WHEN a query with attachments is viewed THEN the system SHALL show all attached documents with download links

### Requirement 3: Query Response with Document Attachment

**User Story:** As a user responding to a query, I want to attach documents with my response, so that I can provide detailed answers with supporting materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user responds to a query THEN the system SHALL provide a document upload interface in the response form
2. WHEN a user attaches documents to a response THEN the system SHALL validate and store them with the response
3. WHEN a query response includes attachments THEN the system SHALL display them in the query thread
4. WHEN viewing query responses THEN the system SHALL show attachment indicators and allow downloads

### Requirement 4: Document Management in Query Context

**User Story:** As a user viewing queries, I want to see all documents associated with the query and its responses, so that I can access all relevant information in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a query details THEN the system SHALL display all documents from the original query and all responses
2. WHEN documents are attached THEN the system SHALL show file names, sizes, upload dates, and uploaded by information
3. WHEN a user clicks on a document THEN the system SHALL allow secure download
4. WHEN multiple documents exist THEN the system SHALL provide bulk download functionality

### Requirement 5: Unified Document Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all document types (workflow, query) to follow the same security model, so that sensitive information is properly protected across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded (workflow or query) THEN the system SHALL apply consistent security controls
2. WHEN users access documents THEN the system SHALL verify they have appropriate permissions based on their role and workflow/query access
3. WHEN documents are downloaded THEN the system SHALL log the access for audit purposes
4. WHEN workflows or queries are in different states THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate document access controls

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Document Reuse Visibility with Source Tracking

**User Story:** As a JVC user, I want to see detailed information about document reuse during workflow extensions, including where each document was originally attached, so that I understand the complete document history and can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are extended with auto-reused documents THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive summary of all reused documents with their original attachment sources
2. WHEN viewing extension results THEN the system SHALL show document names, types, original sources (workflow/query/response), and original attachment context
3. WHEN documents are reused from queries or responses THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "Originally attached to Query #123" or "Originally attached to Response in Query #456"
4. WHEN documents are reused THEN the system SHALL indicate the reuse strategy (automatic vs manual) and show reuse count statistics
5. WHEN no documents are available for reuse THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this in the results
6. WHEN viewing document details THEN the system SHALL show the complete reuse history including all contexts where the document has been used

### Requirement 7: Universal Document Availability for Material Extensions

**User Story:** As a JVC user, I want any document that has ever been attached to any workflow, query, or response for a specific project/material combination to be automatically available when I create new workflows for the same material, so that all relevant documentation is always included regardless of when or where it was originally uploaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new workflow for a project/material combination THEN the system SHALL make available ALL documents ever attached to that project/material from ANY source
2. WHEN documents were attached during initial workflow creation THEN they SHALL be available for reuse in subsequent plant extensions
3. WHEN documents were attached to queries raised during workflow processing THEN they SHALL be available for reuse in new workflows for the same material
4. WHEN documents were attached to query responses THEN they SHALL be available for reuse in new workflows for the same material
5. WHEN documents were attached at any stage of any workflow lifecycle THEN they SHALL contribute to the reusable document pool for that project/material
6. WHEN the system determines reusable documents THEN it SHALL prioritize the most recent versions while maintaining access to all historical documents

### Requirement 8: Integrated Document Search and Management

**User Story:** As a user working with workflows and queries, I want to search and manage all related documents from a unified interface, so that I can efficiently access all relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for documents THEN the system SHALL include workflow, query, and response documents in search results with clear source indicators
2. WHEN viewing workflow details THEN the system SHALL include an option to view all related documents including those from associated queries
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive document information from all sources (workflows, queries, responses)
4. WHEN archiving workflows THEN the system SHALL include all related documents from all sources in the archive
