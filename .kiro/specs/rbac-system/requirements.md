# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the application. The system will support five distinct roles with hierarchical access levels, including a specialized plant-based sub-role system. The RBAC implementation will ensure secure, role-appropriate access to screens, features, and data while maintaining extensibility for future role additions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define and manage user roles with specific access permissions, so that I can control what features and data each user can access based on their organizational responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL support exactly five predefined roles: ADMIN, JVC_ROLE, CQS_ROLE, TECH_ROLE, and PLANT_ROLE
2. WHEN a user is created or updated THEN the system SHALL assign exactly one role from the available roles
3. WHEN role definitions are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain role metadata including permissions and access levels
4. IF new roles need to be added THEN the system SHALL support extensible role configuration without code changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an ADMIN user, I want full access to all application features and data, so that I can perform administrative tasks and oversee all system operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with ADMIN role accesses any screen THEN the system SHALL grant full access without restrictions
2. WHEN an ADMIN user views data THEN the system SHALL display all available data across all plants and modules
3. WHEN an ADMIN user performs actions THEN the system SHALL allow all operations including user management, configuration, and data modification
4. WHEN access control is evaluated for ADMIN THEN the system SHALL bypass all role-based restrictions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with JVC_ROLE, I want access only to JVC-related screens and functionalities, so that I can perform my job duties without being overwhelmed by irrelevant features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with JVC_ROLE attempts to access screens THEN the system SHALL only allow access to JVC-designated screens
2. WHEN a JVC_ROLE user tries to access non-JVC screens THEN the system SHALL deny access and display appropriate error message
3. WHEN JVC_ROLE user views data THEN the system SHALL filter content to show only JVC-relevant information
4. WHEN JVC_ROLE user performs actions THEN the system SHALL restrict operations to JVC-specific functionalities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with CQS_ROLE, I want access exclusively to CQS screens and features, so that I can focus on quality-related tasks without accessing unrelated system areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with CQS_ROLE navigates the application THEN the system SHALL display only CQS-related screens and menu items
2. WHEN a CQS_ROLE user attempts to access technical, JVC, or plant-specific screens THEN the system SHALL deny access
3. WHEN CQS_ROLE user interacts with data THEN the system SHALL present only CQS-relevant datasets and operations
4. WHEN access permissions are evaluated for CQS_ROLE THEN the system SHALL enforce strict boundaries preventing cross-module access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with TECH_ROLE, I want access exclusively to technical screens and functions, so that I can perform technical maintenance and configuration tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with TECH_ROLE logs in THEN the system SHALL present only technical screens and administrative functions
2. WHEN a TECH_ROLE user tries to access business-specific screens (JVC, CQS, plant operations) THEN the system SHALL restrict access
3. WHEN TECH_ROLE user performs operations THEN the system SHALL allow technical configuration, system maintenance, and diagnostic functions
4. WHEN technical data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show system logs, configuration settings, and technical metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with PLANT_ROLE, I want access to plant-related screens with data filtered to my assigned plant codes, so that I can manage operations for my specific plant(s) without seeing irrelevant data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with PLANT_ROLE is created THEN the system SHALL require assignment of one or more plant codes from QRMFG_LOCATIONS table
2. WHEN a PLANT_ROLE user accesses plant screens THEN the system SHALL display only data for their assigned plant codes
3. WHEN plant data queries are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically filter results based on user's assigned plant codes
4. WHEN a PLANT_ROLE user attempts to access non-plant screens THEN the system SHALL deny access
5. IF a PLANT_ROLE user has multiple plant codes assigned THEN the system SHALL aggregate data from all assigned plants

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RBAC system to be easily extensible, so that new roles and sub-role attributes can be added without major system modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new roles are defined THEN the system SHALL support adding them through configuration rather than code changes
2. WHEN sub-role attributes are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a framework for implementing role-specific attributes
3. WHEN role permissions change THEN the system SHALL allow dynamic permission updates without system restart
4. WHEN the system architecture is reviewed THEN it SHALL demonstrate clear separation between role definition, permission management, and access enforcement

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive access logging and audit trails, so that I can monitor role-based access patterns and investigate security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access screens or data THEN the system SHALL log access attempts with user role, timestamp, and resource accessed
2. WHEN access is denied THEN the system SHALL log the denial with reason and user context
3. WHEN role assignments change THEN the system SHALL create audit records of the modifications
4. WHEN security reviews are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive access reports by role and user

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an application user, I want clear feedback when access is restricted, so that I understand why certain features are unavailable and can request appropriate access if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access is denied to a screen THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message explaining the restriction
2. WHEN menu items are filtered by role THEN the system SHALL only show accessible options rather than disabled items
3. WHEN data is filtered by role THEN the system SHALL not indicate the existence of filtered content
4. WHEN users need elevated access THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to request additional permissions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the RBAC system to integrate seamlessly with existing authentication mechanisms, so that role-based access works with current login processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL retrieve and cache their role information for the session
2. WHEN role information is needed THEN the system SHALL provide efficient access to user roles without repeated database queries
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL clear role-based permissions and require re-authentication
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL initialize role definitions and screen mappings from the database
