# Questionnaire Submission Fix

## Problem
After submitting the questionnaire, the progress was being reset and the filled details were not persisting. The questionnaire should be marked as completed in the plant dashboard and everywhere after submission.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Progress Reset Issue**: The `submit()` method in `PlantSpecificData` was not preserving completion statistics
2. **Status Inconsistency**: The completion status was being reset instead of maintained as "COMPLETED"
3. **Dashboard Display Issue**: The dashboard logic wasn't properly checking submission timestamps
4. **Read-Only Check Issue**: The read-only status wasn't being properly determined after submission

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed PlantSpecificData.submit() Method
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/cqs/qrmfg/model/PlantSpecificData.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Preserve completion status as "COMPLETED" instead of "SUBMITTED"
  - Maintain completion percentage (ensure it's at least 90% for submitted questionnaires)
  - Don't reset any completion statistics during submission

### 2. Enhanced Submission Logic in Service
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/cqs/qrmfg/service/PlantQuestionnaireService.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Added duplicate submission check to prevent re-submission
  - Preserve completion stats before and after submission
  - Force completion status to "COMPLETED" for submitted questionnaires
  - Enhanced logging for debugging submission process

### 3. Fixed Dashboard Status Logic
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/cqs/qrmfg/service/PlantQuestionnaireService.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Primary check for completion status is now submission timestamp (`submittedAt`)
  - If questionnaire is submitted, it's always marked as "COMPLETED" regardless of workflow state
  - Improved status determination logic in `getPlantDashboardData()`

### 4. Enhanced Read-Only Status Check
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/cqs/qrmfg/service/PlantQuestionnaireService.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Primary check is submission timestamp (`submittedAt`)
  - Added logging for debugging read-only status
  - Improved error handling

### 5. Fixed Status Methods in Model
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/cqs/qrmfg/model/PlantSpecificData.java`
- **Changes**:
  - `isCompleted()` now checks submission timestamp in addition to status
  - `isSubmitted()` now relies on submission timestamp rather than status string

### 6. Enhanced Controller Submission Endpoint
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/cqs/qrmfg/controller/PlantQuestionnaireController.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive logging for submission process
  - Enhanced error handling and status reporting
  - Include current status in error responses

### 7. Added Completion Stats Method
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/cqs/qrmfg/service/PlantQuestionnaireService.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `getCompletionStats()` method for retrieving current completion statistics
  - Enhanced `getQuestionnaireStatus()` to avoid validation on submitted questionnaires

## Key Improvements

1. **Persistent Completion Status**: Once submitted, questionnaires maintain their completion status and progress
2. **Proper Read-Only Behavior**: Submitted questionnaires are properly marked as read-only
3. **Dashboard Accuracy**: Plant dashboard correctly shows completed questionnaires
4. **Duplicate Submission Prevention**: System prevents accidental re-submission
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information for troubleshooting

## Testing Steps

1. **Fill out a questionnaire** with plant-specific data
2. **Submit the questionnaire** using the submit endpoint
3. **Verify completion status** is maintained as "COMPLETED"
4. **Check dashboard** shows the questionnaire as completed
5. **Verify read-only status** prevents further editing
6. **Confirm progress persistence** - completion percentage and field counts are maintained

## API Endpoints Affected

- `POST /api/v1/plant-questionnaire/submit` - Enhanced submission logic
- `GET /api/v1/plant-questionnaire/status` - Improved status reporting
- `GET /api/v1/plant-questionnaire/readonly` - Enhanced read-only check
- `GET /api/v1/plant-questionnaire/dashboard` - Fixed completion status display

## Database Fields Used

- `submitted_at` - Primary indicator of submission status
- `submitted_by` - Who submitted the questionnaire
- `completion_status` - Should be "COMPLETED" for submitted questionnaires
- `completion_percentage` - Maintained after submission
- `total_fields`, `completed_fields` - Preserved completion statistics

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ Questionnaire submission preserves all completion data
2. ✅ Dashboard shows submitted questionnaires as "COMPLETED"
3. ✅ Submitted questionnaires are read-only
4. ✅ Progress bars and statistics remain accurate
5. ✅ No duplicate submissions allowed
6. ✅ Proper error messages for submission attempts on completed questionnaires
