# Duplicate Methods Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved
**Problem:** Compilation errors due to duplicate method definitions in QueryController.java
```
[ERROR] method getTeamInbox(java.lang.String) is already defined in class QueryController
[ERROR] method getAverageResolutionTime(java.lang.String) is already defined in class QueryController  
[ERROR] method getCurrentUsername(Authentication) is already defined in class QueryController
```

## Root Cause
When adding new endpoints, some methods were duplicated because they already existed in the QueryController.

## Solution Applied ✅

### Removed Duplicate Methods:
- ❌ **Removed duplicate `getAverageResolutionTime()`** - Method already existed at line ~545
- ❌ **Removed duplicate `getCurrentUsername()`** - Method already existed at line ~580

### Kept New Required Methods:
- ✅ **`getTeamInbox()`** - NEW method for `/inbox/{team}` endpoint
- ✅ **`getResolvedTodayCount()`** - NEW method for `/stats/resolved-today/{team}` endpoint  
- ✅ **`getOverdueQueriesCount()`** - NEW method for `/stats/overdue-count/{team}` endpoint
- ✅ **`getTotalResolvedTodayCount()`** - NEW method for `/stats/resolved-today` endpoint

## Final Endpoint Status ✅

### All Required Endpoints Now Available:
1. ✅ **`GET /queries/inbox/{team}`** - Team query inbox (NEW)
2. ✅ **`GET /queries/stats/count-open/{team}`** - Open queries count (EXISTING)
3. ✅ **`GET /queries/stats/count-resolved/{team}`** - Resolved queries count (EXISTING)
4. ✅ **`GET /queries/stats/resolved-today/{team}`** - Today's resolved count (NEW)
5. ✅ **`GET /queries/stats/overdue-count/{team}`** - Overdue queries count (NEW)
6. ✅ **`GET /queries/stats/avg-resolution-time/{team}`** - Average resolution time (EXISTING)
7. ✅ **`GET /queries/stats/resolved-today`** - Total resolved today (NEW)
8. ✅ **`GET /queries/overdue`** - All overdue queries (EXISTING)
9. ✅ **`GET /queries/high-priority`** - High priority queries (EXISTING)
