# Final Implementation Status - Complete Success âœ…

## All Issues Resolved Successfully

### âœ… 1. Enhanced Query Workflow Assignment Logic
**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**What was implemented:**
- Multi-query support for Plant questionnaires
- Chronological assignment based on first query creation time
- Proper workflow state transitions between query teams
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Plant can raise Q1â†’JVC, Q2â†’CQS, Q3â†’TECH, Q4â†’JVC
- System assigns workflow to team with chronologically first query
- When queries resolved, workflow moves to next chronological team
- When all queries resolved, workflow returns to PLANT_PENDING

### âœ… 2. Workflow State Transition Fixes
**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**What was fixed:**
- Updated `WorkflowState.canTransitionTo()` to allow query state â†” query state transitions
- Updated `WorkflowServiceImpl.validateStateTransition()` to permit inter-query-state transitions
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

**Now Working:**
- CQS_PENDING â†’ TECH_PENDING âœ…
- TECH_PENDING â†’ JVC_PENDING âœ…  
- JVC_PENDING â†’ CQS_PENDING âœ…
- All existing transitions preserved âœ…

### âœ… 3. TECH User Permissions Fix
**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**What was fixed:**
- Added "query" and "document" data type access for TECH users in RBACConstants
- Added missing API endpoints in QueryController:
  - `/queries/inbox/{team}` - Team query inbox
  - `/queries/stats/resolved-today/{team}` - Today's resolved count
  - `/queries/stats/overdue-count/{team}` - Overdue queries count
  - `/queries/stats/avg-resolution-time/{team}` - Average resolution time
  - `/queries/stats/resolved-today` - Total resolved today

**TECH Users Can Now:**
- Access query inbox and view assigned queries âœ…
- View team-specific statistics and dashboards âœ…
- Resolve queries with responses and attachments âœ…
- Upload documents to query responses âœ…
- Access all query management features âœ…

### âœ… 4. Compilation Issues Fixed
**Status: FULLY RESOLVED**

**What was fixed:**
- Corrected class structure in QueryController.java
- Properly placed new methods inside class definition
- Removed duplicate closing braces
- All files now compile successfully
